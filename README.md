# kobackupdec
Huawei backup decryptor

_This script is introduced by the blog post at TODO._

The `kobackupdec` script is a Python3 script aimed to decrypt Huawei *HiSuite* or *KoBackup* backups. When decrypting and uncompressing the archives, it will re-organize the output folders structure trying to _mimic_ the typical Android one. The script will work both on Windows and Linux hosts, provided the PyCryptoDome dependency.
